# Art Market Platform ‚Äì Transaction & Compliance Module (NDA Project)

**Note:** This is a portfolio summary of a commercial project developed under NDA. Source code is not publicly available.

## üé® Project Overview

This project involved the development of a digital platform for managing and facilitating the trade of artworks between galleries and individual collectors. The system supports a range of operations from cataloging and pricing to secure transaction workflows and compliance verification.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Role

I joined the project during its mid-phase and was responsible for the **implementation of the banking & compliance module**, which served as an internal tool for financial institutions.

Key responsibilities included:

- Creating a **secure banking interface** for transaction officers
- Building views for transaction detail review, buyer/seller participant verification, and document uploads
- Implementing logic for **KYC (Know Your Customer) flow** integration
- Ensuring smooth handoff of verified cases to compliance teams
- Designing a user-friendly interface with a high level of data clarity
- Working within an existing React-based architecture and integrating seamlessly with backend APIs
- **Implementing components based on high-fidelity Figma designs**, ensuring UI consistency and accessibility

- The project followed an Agile workflow in Jira, and I maintained close coordination with the backend team to align data structures and API expectations. I collaborated with testers to cover edge cases in the KYC flow and handled UI logic for document handling and validation. Even though I joined mid-project, I quickly synchronized with the team and frequently took part in internal demo sessions to present progress and clarify interaction logic.

Thanks to my prior experience in the finance sector, I was able to contribute to the UX of the banking module ‚Äî ensuring that flows for data verification, transaction overview, and document uploads met real-world expectations of banking professionals. I also had a direct influence on the design of some interface components, working iteratively with designers to improve clarity and usability based on domain knowledge. Final visuals were built based on Figma.

I worked on this project for approximately **4 months**, collaborating closely with backend developers and the product owner.
